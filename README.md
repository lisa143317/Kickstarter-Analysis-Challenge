# Kickstarter-Analysis-Challenge
##Performing analysis on kick-starter data to discover trends
#### Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
	- In an effort to increase the success of Louise's kickstarter campaign, data of several thousand kickstarters is organized and examined. 
Ultimately the analysis yields several factors that correlate to successful kickstarters.

### Purpose
	- The purpose of the project is to uncover trends in the data that strongly correlate to positive or negative outcomes that are statistically significant.

#### Analysis and Challenges
	- The analysis was fairly simple to perform. With the use of filters, such as parent category of "theatre" and subcateogry of "plays", breaking the thousands of kickstarters down was simple. However, to do a full analysis, various additional aspects are filtered to uncover any hidden trends. Furthermore, putting the data in a more userfriendly format is key to analyzing the data. For example, changing the unix timestamps to common date form allowsfor a quick categorization of kickstarters into time of year. Combining time of year with outcome reveals key trends.
	- Challenges of this analysis relate to the seemingly countless ways you can filter the data. For example,the country of origin and type of kickstarter may be correlated. Selecting the most relevant factors does not always uncover trends. 
###### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	- The analysis reveals that kickstarters that end in the summer months, peaking in July, are nearly 2.5times more successful than those ending in the beginning and end of the year.
####### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	- Kickstarters that ask for less than $1000 are most likely to succeed, versus higher denominations. However, success is also more likely when in the $35,000 to $45,000 range.
